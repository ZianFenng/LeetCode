# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
Oct.09.2017
#Job/LeetCode
- Intuition
	- Go through the list first, donâ€™t look at node.random
	- while traversing, record all oldListNode:newListNode pair in a dictionary, old node as key, new node as value
	- Go through the two lists at the same time. if old.random == None: next node else: new.random = dict[oldNode]
- Idea from discussion [A solution with constant space complexity O(1) and linear time complexity O(N) | LeetCode Discuss](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/7594/a-solution-with-constant-space-complexity-o-1-and-linear-time-complexity-o-n)
	- The algorithm is composed of the follow three steps which are also 3 iteration rounds.
		1. Iterate the original list and duplicate each node. The duplicate of each node follows its original immediately.
		2. Iterate the new list and assign the random pointer for each duplicated node.
		3. Restore the original list and extract the duplicated nodes.
