# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
Oct.09.2017
#Job/LeetCode
- Intuition
	- Go through the list first, donâ€™t look at node.random
	- while traversing, record all oldListNode:newListNode pair in a dictionary, old node as key, new node as value
	- Go through the two lists at the same time. if old.random == None: next node else: new.random = dict[oldNode]
