# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Oct.29.2017
#Job/LeetCode
- Intuition
	- Use counter to count frequency
	- Use the most common method to output the sorted letters based on frequency
	- Rebuild the string
		- In my answer, a function called most_common() is used.
		- More commonly, a priority queue will be used.

# An invalid answer, since sorted() function is stable, so when two letters have the same frequncy, the result is wrong
