# 532. K-diff Pairs in an Array

- Hint from discussions
	- Use mapping type: dictionary/set
	- Revise my intuition answer can speed up a little, but still won’t work since sorting is used.
	- Steps:
		- Check inputs, if k < 0 or n == 0, the input is invalid, return 0
		- if k == 0, special case, use dictionary, output the number of keys, whose value is larger than 1.
		- else, return the size of intersection of set of nums and set of num + k for num in nums
	- Overall time complexity is big-oh(n)
```
class Solution(object):
    def findPairs(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        
        if k < 0 or n == 0:
            return 0
        
        if k == 0:
            res = {}
            count = 0
            for num in nums:
                if num in res:
                    if res[num] >= 1:
                        pass
                    else:
                        count += 1
                    res[num] += 1
                else:
                    res[num] = 0
            return count
        else:
            # res = set(nums)
            return len(set(nums) & set(n+k for n in nums))
```
- Hint from Zoem
	- Actually, she meant buckets, which is exactly the same as hash map
	- Use bucket sort
	- Bucket sort, or bin sort
		- A sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.
		- A distribution sort and is a cousin of radix sort in the most to least significant digit flavor
```
function bucketSort(array, n) is
  buckets ← new array of n empty lists
  for i = 0 to (length(array)-1) do
    insert array[i] into buckets[msbits(array[i], k)]
  for i = 0 to n - 1 do
    nextSort(buckets[i]);
  return the concatenation of buckets[0], ...., buckets[n-1]		
```

- My intuition
	- 排序后，用两个循环嵌套，遍历所有Possible pairs
	- Time: big-oh(nlgn) + big-oh(n^2) —> big-oh(n^2), too slow, but works
	- line”if num[i] not in res :” is really slow, since a linked list is used here, the time complexity is big-oh(s), s is the size of res. if a mapping type is used, the finding process is of complexity big-oh(1). But even so, it’s slow, for the sorting.
```
class Solution(object):
    def findPairs(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if k < 0:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n-1):
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                diff = nums[j] - nums[i]
                if diff < k:
                    continue
                elif diff == k:
                    if nums[i] not in res:
                        res.append(nums[i])
                else:
                    break
        # print(res)
        return len(res)
```
