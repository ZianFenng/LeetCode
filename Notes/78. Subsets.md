# 78. Subsets

#Job/LeetCode
- Intuition
	- big-oh(n^2) algorithm, might be too slow
	- Maintain a list of sets
	- Maintain two pointer which indicates the beginning and ending index of sets of size i-1 at round i 
	- for every set of size i-1: for every element in nums: if num in set: continue else: append set | set(num) to the list
	- â€¦ No intention to implement this algorithm
- Hint: bit multiplication
	- Total combination: 2^n, (for n nums, showing up (1) not showing up (0))
	- for i in range(2^n): 
		- get representation in binary 
		- for j in binary representation
			- if j == 1: append
		- append
- Code 49 ms
